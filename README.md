# Hello, everyone!! It's me @jorgearaujo81

In 2021, I'm a student of _Computer Science_ at [Cesar School](https://www.cesar.school/). And I'm interested in learning several different programming languages.
At present I'm still learning English, cause it's important to contact people around the world.
So, that's all in the momento about me.
If you need please contact me via email at jorge.araujo81@gmail.com.
I am looking for collaborators around the world to teach and learn together
